The purpose of this treatment is to establish a creative vision for our project. In addition to verbal descriptions, we've included links to reference material to help convey style, mood, and tone.

## Initial Concept

The story is centered around a seasoned father getting dressed for his little girls' special day. We will see him picking out the perfect shirt/suit/tie, looking in the mirror to tie the perfect knot, shining his dress shoes, shaving, etc. While we're seeing all of this, we'll also see his daughter getting ready: opening her dress from a big box with a bow, looking in the mirror, brushing her hair, etc. Additionally, there will be a few scenes where the daughter and her dad "interact" such as: she runs past the door in excitement as her dad is shaving, or we see her twirling in the mirror while her dad ties his neck tie, but when he looks back she'e gone. Just then she pops out of the closet and surprises him... Scenes like these will be important for the end of the film.

Throughout the entire montage, a narrator (Mark) will be reading something poetic; similar to the small Ad you wrote about the toast for your daughter. Same type of vibe --- heartfelt, uplifting, intriguing.

The story concludes with a twist... the father, eyes closed, waits to see his daughter in her dress, when a grown woman's hands reach around from behind to cover his eyes, prompting him to turn around and see that his daughter is fully grown and she's in her wedding dress on her wedding day. We may even do cross cut of his young daughter's face at that time to drive home the point that while he was getting ready, he was remembering all the special moments they've shared In the past leading up to this day.

The video will finish with words on the screen; something like, "Savor what's special" which will tie into the theme of the voiceover. Fade to black --- Canlis.

## Inspiration Material

**1\. Dear Brother**

I like everything about this commercial, especially the way they foreshadow the big twist but you only realize it after the fact. It makes you want to watch it again to discover new meaning. This is a really good example of the overall emotion, mood and tone I'm envisioning for our project. I was inspired in my concept from this piece, as you'll see.

**2\. Do Not Go Gentle**

I love the subtle moments of humanity in this piece, especially through the faces and situations of the characters. Specifically, when Hulk Hogan smiles after the janitor gives him a head nod, or the way the guy in the car is a different person outside his day job, or the vulnerability in the eyes of the guy working out. These kinds of details communicate so much about what a character is thinking and feeling, and it allows the audience to use their imagination. I want to replicate this vibe of visual storytelling.

**3\. More than Brains**

My favorite moment in this piece is when the waitress looks at the camera with smirk on her face (above). It goes perfectly with the song and adds influence into how she's feeling. Additionally, I like the mood and overall humanity of the many scenarios they show. It feels real and authentic. I want to showcase authenticity in our piece as well.

Overall, these examples layer atmospheric sound and visuals to drive their story and communicate emotion. That's what I'm going for with our piece, something that connects universally and emotionally.
