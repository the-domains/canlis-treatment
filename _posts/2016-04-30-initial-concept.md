# Savor every second.

The purpose of this film is to elicit emotions around a universal truth: life's special moments are worth savoring. This treatment aims to establish a creative vision for the film. In addition to verbal descriptions, I've included links to reference material to help convey mood, style, and tone.

## Concept

The story is centered around an established father getting dressed for his little girl's special day. We will see him picking out the perfect shirt/suit/tie, looking in the mirror to tie the perfect knot, shining his dress shoes, shaving, writing in a card, etc. While we're seeing all of this, we'll also see glimpses of his daughter getting ready; opening a dress from a big box with a bow, holding her dress in front of the mirror, etc. There will be a few scenes where the two "interact" with each other: she's peeking around the corner watching him shave and when he looks she hides, or we see her twirling in the mirror behind him while he ties his neck tie. _The scenes featuring father & daughter together will be important to the end of the film._

Throughout the montage, our narrator (Mark?) will be reading something poetic that loosely relates to what we're seeing. Something similar to the "toast" Ad you wrote. Same kind of mood --- emotional, epic, and intriguing.

Our story concludes with a twist... with hands over his eyes, counting, the father waits to see his daughter in her dress. Just then, manicured hands reach from behind to uncover his eyes, prompting him to turn around and see his daughter fully grown; she's wearing her wedding dress on her wedding day. Through the words spoken and the build up of visuals to this moment, the audience will realize the entire time he was getting ready, he was actually _remembering_ the little moments they've shared leading up to this day.

The video will finish with words on the screen; something like, "Savor every second" which will also tie into the theme of the voiceover. Fade to black --- Canlis.

## Inspirations

**1\. Dear Brother **--- I like everything about this commercial, especially the way they foreshadow the big twist but you only realize it after the fact. It makes you want to watch it again to discover new meaning. This is a really good example of the overall emotion, mood and tone I'm envisioning for our project. I was inspired in my concept from this piece, as you'll see.

**2\. Do Not Go Gentle --- **I love the subtle moments of humanity in this piece shown through the faces and situations of each characters. Particularly when Hulk Hogan smiles after the janitor gives him a head nod, or how the guy in the car has an alter ego, and the sort of vulnerability in the eyes of the guy working out. These kinds of details communicate so much about what they're thinking and feeling. I want to replicate this vibe of visual storytelling.

**3\. More than Brains ---** My favorite moment in this piece is the smirk on the waitresses face (seen below). It's perfectly timed in the song and it adds a rich picture into what how she is feeling.

## Summary

These examples all create atmosphere through purposeful visuals & sound to drive the story and communicate emotion. That's what I'm going for with our piece, something that connects universally and emotionally.
